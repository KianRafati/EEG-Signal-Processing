# EEG-Signal-Processing
This project is mainly about EEG signal processing. In the first phase of the project I have preprocessed the data (i.e. cleansed the given signals from baseline noise and other sources of noise) and in the second phase I have use machine learning functions of MATLAB to determine the time of epileptic seizure of the patient.
